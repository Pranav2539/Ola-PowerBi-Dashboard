# 🚖 OLA Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze OLA cab booking performance, revenue trends, cancellation behavior, and ride demand over time using a structured, real-world-like dataset.

---

## Overview
This project presents a business intelligence dashboard built in Power BI to analyze booking performance, revenue trends, and operational efficiency for a ride-hailing platform like OLA.

---

## Tech Stack
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Data Modeling
- .pbix and .png formats

---

## Data Source
**Source:** Synthetic OLA-style cab booking dataset

The dataset is synthetically generated to replicate real-world ride-hailing operations. It includes booking dates, booking status, ride values, vehicle types, and time-based demand patterns. No real customer or proprietary company data is used.

### Dashboard Objectives
- Monitor overall booking performance and revenue
- Analyze booking success versus cancellations
- Track ride demand trends over time
- Enable interactive, time-based analysis
